  title: AD9783-EBZ HDL project
  description: >
    The AD9783 includes pin-compatible, high dynamic range, dual digital-to-analog
    converters (DACs) with 16-bit resolution, and sample rates of up to 500 MSPS.

    The device includes specific features for direct conversion transmit applications,
    including gain and offset compensation, interfacing seamlessly with analog quadrature
    modulators.

    The EVAL-AD9783 board is connected to the FPGA carrier through AD-DAC-FMC-ADP
    interposer board.

    It targets the AMD Xilinx ZCU102.
