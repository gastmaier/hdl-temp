  description: >
    The I3C Controller Host Interface peripheral allows asynchronous interrupt-driven
    memory-mapped access to a I3C Controller Control Interface. This is typically
    used in combination with a software program to dynamically generate I3C transactions.

    The peripheral also has support for providing memory-mapped access to one or more
    i3c_controller offload-interface cores and change its content dynamically at runtime.
