  title: AXI_TDD HDL IP core 2027_r1
  description: >
    The AXI Time-Division Duplexing Controller IP core is a pulse wave generator capable
    of addressing RF applications which require Time Division Duplexing, as well as
    controlling other modules of general applications through its dedicated 32 channel
    outputs.

    The reason of creating the generic TDD controller was to reduce the naming confusion
    around the existing repurposed TDD core built for AD9361, as well as expanding
    its number of output channels for systems which require more than six controlling
    signals.
